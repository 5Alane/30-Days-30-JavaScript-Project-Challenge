Day 1 of challenge to build 30 JS projects over 30 days (Study with us with timer, video and music)
A vanilla JS project with three primary files (index.html, index.js and style.css), as well as svg files for the play and pause buttons and the timer effect. Videos (free from pixabay) uses in the background.
Times can be updated to changed to adjust the meditation timeframes offered, with alternative videos and music possible to change also.


**Disclaimer**

No copyright infringement intended with this app. I planned to create a meditation app for day 3, and there was no music more soothing that I could think of than Einaudi, and therefore this pays homage. Please go buy his music from iTunes, stream it on Spotify or go see him in concert.

**Day 02 : Rock, Paper and Scissors Game**

Wanna to take a quick look? - [Visit Now]()

An experiment involving a game of rock, paper and scissor. During the first 3 rounds the computer chooses a move (rock, paper or scissor) at random. After that, it assumes it has enough data about the player to predict it's pattern. The data set consists of the player last two moves, being the last one, the one they'll do after the first one. Kind of confusing, right?! Simple put, the computer stores the first move as a input x and the move after that as a label or target y, meaning that after the player choosing rock, for instance, there's a possibility they'll choose paper as the next move. If the computer predicts the player will play rock, it plays paper, so on and so forth. Every time the computer loses, it trains the neural network again.
